# Azure VNet Utilization Monitoring Solution README

## Overview

This solution is designed to monitor the utilization of Virtual Networks (VNets) in your Azure environment. It collects data about each subnet within your VNets, including the total number of IP addresses, used IP addresses, and available IP addresses. Additionally, it evaluates a specific condition: whether the used IP count in a subnet is greater than or equal to 80% of the total IP count for that subnet. If this condition is met, it assigns a value of 1; otherwise, it assigns a value of 0. The reason for that is to create azure alert query this value, if the value is 1 it will create fire alert.
Azure workbook also is used to visualize the data collected by the azure function.

## Components

This solution comprises four key components:

1. **Azure Function**: The Azure Function is responsible for executing the monitoring script. It collects data about your VNets, evaluates subnet utilization, and stores the results.

2. **Log Analytics - Custom Table**: Azure Log Analytics hosts a custom table where the collected VNet utilization data is securely stored in JSON format. You can query this table to retrieve historical data and perform analysis.

3. **Azure Workbook**: Azure Workbook is a powerful tool for visualizing data from the custom table. You can create customized dashboards and reports to monitor VNet utilization trends effectively.

4. **Azure Alert**: Azure Alert continuously monitors the condition values generated by the Azure Function. If a condition value of 1 is detected, signifying high subnet utilization, the alert triggers an immediate notification.
